Hateful and bigoted but not as much as the others.

They happily compromise with the far-right, repeat its dogwhistles, amplify its theories and reuse its populist strategies. They pave the way for the fascists to take power by normalizing them, although they claim to be against all the extremes. Their discourse equate the far-right and the far-left, but they're more affraid of the anti-fascist than of the fascists. Some of them even play with fire, pushing the far-right to the centerstage as a political opponent that they hope to always win against.

Includes people who can't learn a lesson from history, conservatives, neo-liberals, "centrists" (not from the right, nor from the left, so completely at the right), etc.
